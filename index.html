        <h2> <em>The beginning</em> </h2>

        <p>The <em>Radiance</em> was essentially an old god, referred to as the <em>Old Light</em>, who created the moth tribe and potentially all of bugkind. However, under the <em>Radiance</em>, bugs were something of a hivemind, reduced to their base instincts. It seems to consider the <em>Void</em> its ancient enemy and has the power to manifest in the dreams of bugs. Then came the <em>Wyrm</em>, another ancient being, who died at the <strong>Kingdom's Edge</strong> and reincarnated as the <em>Pale King</em>.</p>

        <p>He built <strong><em>Hollownest</em></strong> and became a new beacon of light, supplanting the <em>Radiance</em> and expanding the minds of all bugs under his influence. To rule as the only god, he tried to get rid of the <em>Radiance</em>, but it could not simply be forgotten. So the <em>Pale King</em> drew upon the powers of the <strong>Void</strong>, experimenting to create a perfect hollow vessel to seal the <em>Radiance</em> away.</p>

        <p>After a long and arduous process, he created the <strong><em>Hollow Knight</em></strong>, who he deemed the perfect vessel, and convinced three powerful bugs to become <em>Dreamers</em> and act as a seal. So now the <em>Radiance</em> was contained within the <strong><em>Hollow Knight</em></strong>, who was further imprisoned in the <strong>Black Egg</strong> and sealed by the power of the <em>Dreamers</em>.</p>

        <p>Still, the <em>Radiance</em> managed to leak out over time. It appeared to bugs in their dreams, and its presence manifested as the orange infection that you can see everywhere around <strong>Hallownest</strong>, robbing bugs of their expanded minds and reducing them to husks. Now it's the job of your character, another vessel who was presumably deemed a failure, to take up the mantle of <strong><em>Hollow Knight</em></strong> and replace him as a vessel to seal the <em>Radiance</em>, but first the failing seals have to be undone by destroying the <em>Dreamers</em>, and the old <strong><em>Hollow Knight</em></strong> slain.</p>

        <p>Under the guidance of <em>Hornet</em>, who is also a creature of the <strong>Void</strong>, but somehow different, you find another path. You go first to the cast-off shell of the <strong>Wyrm</strong> to obtain his power of kingship and use it to open the door to the <strong>Abyss</strong> where you were created. There, you face your past as a creature of the <strong>Void</strong>, and with the power of the <em>Kingsoul</em>, manage to unite this dark chaos under your command. Finally, with the <strong>Void</strong> at your beck and call, the aid of <em>Hornet</em> and the awoken <em>Dream Nail</em>, you can not only contain the <em>Radiance</em>, but enter the dream of the <strong><em>Hollow Knight</em></strong> to face the <em>Radiance</em> itself and consume it instead, destroying it for good.</p>

        <h2> Is the <em>Radiance</em> really dead?</h2>

        <p> We won't really know for sure, but if that is the case, we still have <strong><em>Hollow Knight</em></strong> who stopped the <em>Radiance</em> once and if needed, he will again.</p>
